Technologies used:

- HTML

Tools:

Visual Studio Code

Outcome:

Used HTML and CSS to create an NFT card preview. I was able to get everything done, but I got stuck on how to make the hover effect for the image. 

What I learned: I learned to approach front end projects by doing the mobile layout first. Doing this made things smoother because resizing when I resized the page nothing went wrong it was all still how it was supposed to be, and this is something I've been struggling on so now I know how to fix it which is by starting with the mobile design first.
